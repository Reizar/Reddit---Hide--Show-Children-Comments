# Reddit - Hide / Show Children Comments

This is a small Chrome extension that I built after wanting to only read
top level comments on AskReddit threads. 
There is probably something already out there for this, but I decided to make 
my own.

___When on a Reddit comments page:___ 
- "Alt + h" to hide children comments.
-"Alt + s" to show children comments.
